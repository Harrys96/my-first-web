  <p>It was a disappointing opening weekend for Liverpool as they drew 2-2 against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday in what was a below par performance from Jurgen Klopp's team.
Manchester City responded to Liverpool dropping two points with a comfortable 2-0 victory at West Ham on Sunday thanks to two goals from new signing Erling Haaland.
Tottenham Hotspur, Bournemouth, Arsenal, and Newcastle United currently share top spot on goal difference with Pep Guardiola's team.</p>
